   <ul>
  <li><h4>First Step</h4></li>
  <p>Make sure you have all the proper documentation such as passport , visas, and tickets for atractions (To be able to get in and out).
      In much of Europe, the only travel document a US or Canadian citizen needs is a passport.<br>
      (The US Passport Card works only for those driving or cruising to Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, and the Caribbean.)
       And for most American travelers, that passport gets the most scrutiny from a customs official
      …as you reenter the United States.<b>
      
    </b>You can find all the details needed to travel to Europe in this website.

    <li><h4>Second Step</h4></li>
    <p>Plan the dates (asking for PTO or maybe work on the round might be a good idea).<br>
        Start the search for the flight tickets in advance might be a good idea since you can avoid overpriced flights.
        Also check for holiday and big events happening where you decide to visit it  might be a great solution to avoid crowed places.

      <li><h4>Third Step </h4></li>
      <p>"Budgeting before and during the trip can be crucial.This also goes along with the getting organized step but something that I suggest to you do that I did not do very well is budget your money.
       Decide somewhat ahead of time how much you want to spend during the entirety of your trip as well as how much you may need to put aside for an emergency.
       I definitely could have benefited from setting a budget for myself and sticking to it because I ended up running through a good chunk of my savings once all was said done. 
       As always, there are going to be some unexpected costs but it’s a good idea to at least have some sort of maximum budget for yourself so that you don’t spend too much too quickly.
       Additionally, if you haven’t told your bank that you’re going to be travelling outside of the country ahead of time, let your bank know that you’re going to be travelling to multiple places so that they don’t put a hold on your account. Even if you’re already abroad but haven’t told them that you’re to be travelling within other countries it’s a good idea to figure out a way to contact them so that you have full access to your accounts."</p>
